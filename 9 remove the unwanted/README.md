While trying to dockerize an application our primary goal is to make sure that the application runâ€™s inside of a docker container successfully. It often happens that after choosing the base image, there are a lot of tools and packages, utilities that do come along with the image its either that we can choose to use -slim /-minimal version of the image or prefer to remove tools and utilities which might not be needed.
